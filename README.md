# html_baker
This is a light-weight, bloat-free, HTML pre-processor in Python for standing up 
HTML websites. html_baker is a quick-and-dirty way to standardize
parts of the HTML page across multiple HTML files. It works a lot like server-side 
includes.

Create a config file at `configs/config.json` for your site.
